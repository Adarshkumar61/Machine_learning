Machine learning : machine learning is a field of study which gives computer the ability
to think and do tasks without human intervention

There are 3 types of Ml
1. superviesed learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning

1. supervised learning:
<<<<<<< HEAD

 takes input and ouput to make prediction 
 we give alot of data to our model and their result and 
 we train data now after training we expect from model is to:
 whenever there is new data it should make accurate prediction.
 the more we give data the more accurate model will be and the  more accurate our prediction will be.

2. Unsupervised learning:

takes only input not label:
based on that label tries model tries to know the relation.
in this we use:
K-Means clustring method
and more..

3. Reinforcement learning:
takes no input and output 
learn from real world experience
has an agent which uses trial and error method to learn


feature engineering:
A process that involves the following steps:
1. Determining which features might be useful in training a model.
2. Converting raw data from the dataset into efficient versions of those features.
 
1. Ridge
2. Lasso

Ridge and Lasso regression are regularization techniques used in linear regression to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

Ridge regression uses L2 regularization,
which adds the square of the coefficients as a penalty,

ridge add : lambda(slope)*2

while Lasso regression uses L1 regularization,
which adds the absolute value of the coefficients as a penalty

lasso add : lambda|slope|

hii everyone i am adarsh kumar and i am gonna start company very soon but before starting a company i would love to get a job because there are some fortunate reasons :
1. as i need money to start that's 
2. to know the fundamentals of business , that i think is very important to know before starting a company 
and my main motive behind starting a company is to help humanity , to save humanity from dangers where no one supports like natural disasters fire,
and we all get to hear about astroids that astroids gonna hit earth and we all gonna die.
so there should be something that can really help to save humanity and the only way to save humanity and other living beings is to become multiplanatory civilization.
normal machines cant do that , but if we create a suoer autonomous robots that will use his full potential to exlore and research to develop a planet to create a habitat for human beings.
so i am gonna do that no matter how many years it will take but i am gonna build it definietly.

 the more we give data the more accurate predictions will be more accurate.
