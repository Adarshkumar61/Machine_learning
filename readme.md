Machine learning : machine learning is a field of study which gives computer the ability
to think and do tasks without human intervention

There are 3 types of Ml
1. superviesed learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning

1. supervised learning:
 takes input and ouput to make prediction 
 we give alot of data to our model and their result and 
 we train data
 now after training we expect from model is to:
 whenever there is new data it should make accurate prediction.

 the more we give data the more accurate predictions will be more accurate.
